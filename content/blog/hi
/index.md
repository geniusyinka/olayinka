So uh, this is my blog?

Hello every one, name Yinka. A Software Engineer, Photographer and problem solver. This is the very first post on my static blog designed with gatsbyJs, hosted on github and made available by netlify. 

I'll be talking about a few things on here. Sharing the challanges I will be facing while setting this blog up and also writing about how I over came them. I'm new to react, so all of this is completely foreign to me, but I am absolutely excited about getting my hands dirty. 

Talk sooon. Stalk me on here:

twitter
gram
github
